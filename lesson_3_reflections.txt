1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Use a remote repository when you want to share it publicly so that it can be accessed by others 
or by you and a different machine.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manual pulls gives the programmer a chance to set his/her repository is in a good state before recieving new information from the pull.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- forks: a copy of a repository that will reside in the programmer's github account.
Use a fork get a starting point for a project that you want to work on. Push/pulls using the forked repository do not automatically affect the orignal repository. 

- clones: a copy of a repository that will reside on the programmers local machine.
Use clone to locally build commit history. Then push/pull from original repository when needed.

- branch: a reference to the latest commit in a particular path of commits in a repository.
Use branches to explore new ideas you might want to incorporate into your production code base.

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
When you don't have internet access, you local repository can still give the programmer information on how the local branches differ from the last known state of the remote branches.
